  <p>I have a passion for the visual arts and I've been exhibiting my photographs in galleries for over twenty years. Along with a scientific mind, I worked as an application engineer. And in my spare time I love to travel.</p>

  <p>When I'm not doing the above, I like to read positive psychology, business, and finance books. I also like to write, hike, cook, play the guitar, and learn Chinese.</p>

  <p>One of my goals in life is to see the world. I'm currently on a <a class="page-link" href="https://www.hiattzhao.com" target="_blank">world bicycling/backpacking tour <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
